                        <li>Put the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a bowl. Mix them well so the dry ingredients are evenly combined.</li>
                        <li>In a separate bowl, crack the egg and add the milk, melted butter or oil, and vanilla essence if using. Whisk everything together until the mixture is smooth.In a separate bowl, crack the egg and add the milk, melted butter or oil, and vanilla essence if using. Whisk everything together until the mixture is smooth.</li>
                        <li>Slowly pour the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Gently mix until just combined, making sure not to overmix even if there are a few small lumps.</li>
                        <li>Let the pancake batter rest for about 5 to 10 minutes. This resting time helps the baking powder work and makes the pancakes softer and fluffier.</li>
                        <li>Heat a non-stick pan or frying pan on medium heat and lightly grease it with a little butter or oil. Make sure the pan is warm but not too hot.</li>
                        <li>Pour about one quarter cup of batter into the pan for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface and the edges look set, then gently flip it over.</li>
                        <li>Cook the other side for about one minute or until golden brown. Remove the pancake from the pan and repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
                        <li>Serve the pancakes warm with honey, syrup, butter, fruits, or any topping you like. Enjoy your homemade pancakes.</li>
