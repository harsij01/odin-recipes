        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pancakes are a quick and easy breakfast made from a simple batter of flour, eggs, milk, sugar, and a little baking powder. The ingredients are mixed until smooth, then poured onto a hot pan and cooked until golden on both sides. They’re soft, fluffy, and perfect served warm with toppings like syrup, fruit, or butter.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a bowl. Mix them well so the dry ingredients are evenly combined.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, crack the egg and add the milk, melted butter or oil, and vanilla essence if using. Whisk everything together until the mixture is smooth.In a separate bowl, crack the egg and add the milk, melted butter or oil, and vanilla essence if using. Whisk everything together until the mixture is smooth.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Gently mix until just combined, making sure not to overmix even if there are a few small lumps.</li>
            <li>Let the pancake batter rest for about 5 to 10 minutes. This resting time helps the baking powder work and makes the pancakes softer and fluffier.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick pan or frying pan on medium heat and lightly grease it with a little butter or oil. Make sure the pan is warm but not too hot.</li>
            <li>Pour about one quarter cup of batter into the pan for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface and the edges look set, then gently flip it over.</li>
            <li>Cook the other side for about one minute or until golden brown. Remove the pancake from the pan and repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Serve the pancakes warm with honey, syrup, butter, fruits, or any topping you like. Enjoy your homemade pancakes.</li>
